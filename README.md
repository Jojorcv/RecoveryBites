# 🍽️ RecoveryBites — A Mindful Eating Companion

RecoveryBites is a gentle, user-centered app designed to help individuals build a better relationship with food, reconnect with their bodies, and support emotional well-being through intentional nourishment.

This is not a diet app. It's a support tool meant to make eating well feel easier, grounded, and personal — especially during times of change, stress, or healing.

## ✨ Why This Exists

Alongside community-based peer support and mental health services, learning to nourish myself became a form of stability. In a culture driven by instant gratification, food is often overlooked — yet it deeply affects how we feel and function.

This app was created to make eating well — with compassion and clarity — easier and more sustainable. It’s grounded in the belief that food can be a quiet, powerful support in healing and personal growth.

If you’re feeling disconnected, stuck in cycles of unhealthy eating, or just overwhelmed by what “healthy” even means — this app is for you.  
If you’re trying to get from surviving to **stabilizing**, or from coping to **thriving**, this app is for you.

This isn’t about perfection or performance. It’s about progress, connection, and reclaiming your well-being — one meal, one moment at a time.
